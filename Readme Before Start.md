Simulation of article “A Novel Multi-Agent-based Collaborative Virtual Manufacturing Environment Integrated with Edge Computing Technique”
The file ENSP_simulations are the core program. 
Firstly, please ensure eNSP is downloaded and installed following the instruction uploaded in the repository. eNSP is an open source tool that can be downloaded in the offical website of HUAWEi or other public network.
After installation, please import the core simulation program in the simulation package. The blockdiagram and the package capture example are shown as attachment. The virtual machines in the simulation are substituted by the cellphone, which can triger signals, transmitt and receive data.
We hope you have a better understanding of our conceptual framework after the experience. Any question, please feel free to contact us. 
Thank you so much.
