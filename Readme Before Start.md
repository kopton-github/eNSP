Simulation of article “A Novel Multi-Agent-based Collaborative Virtual Manufacturing Environment Integrated with Edge Computing Technique”
The file ENSP_simulation 1, ENSP_simulation 2 and ENSP_simulation3 are the core program of the simulation. 
Firstly, please ensure eNSP is downloaded and installed following the instruction. The official website for download is https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/en/network-management/ensp-pid-9017384. On 8 July, we accessed the website but found that no software is available(reason unknown). Since the installation package is 413 MB, which is more than the limit size of github. An upload of the installation is not possible. We thereby provide another address in  website (sorry not in English), in which the software can be found and available for download: https://www.ttrar.com/html/152975.html. To download it, an account for Baidu is necessary. After download, the software can be installed according to the "installation instruction".
After installation, import the simulation program in the simulation package.
We hope you have a better understanding of our conceptual framework after the experience. Any question, please feel free to contact us. 
Thank you so much.
